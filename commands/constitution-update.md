## Interview Guidelines

### Dynamic Question Selection

- **Skip unchanged areas**: If user says "keep current", don't ask follow-ups
- **Focus on changes**: Only ask about sections user wants to modify
- **Adaptive depth**: If user wants "comprehensive update", ask more questions
- **Progressive refinement**: Later questions can refine earlier changes

### Question Presentation Format

Each question MUST be presented in this format:

```markdown
## Question [N]: [Question Title]

**Current value**: [Show current setting from constitution]

**What would you like to change it to?**

| Option | Choice | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| A | Keep current | [Current value] |
| B | [Option B] | [What this means] |
| C | [Option C] | [What this means] |
| D | [Option D] | [What this means] |
| E | [Option E] | [What this means] |
| F | [Option F] | [What this means] |
| Custom | [Your own] | Enter your custom value |

**Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_
```

### User Response Handling

- **Accept letter choices**: A, B, C, D, E, F (case-insensitive)
- **Accept "keep" or "current"**: Preserve existing value
- **Accept custom input**: Any text input
- **Allow "skip"**: User can skip questions (keep current)
- **Allow "back"**: User can go back to previous questions
- **Allow "done"**: User can finish early if satisfied

### Change Tracking

- Track all changes: section name, field name, old value, new value
- Display change summary before saving
- Record in modification history table
- Update version number if major changes
- Preserve unchanged sections completely

### Impact Assessment

Before saving, assess impact:
- Which characters may be affected?
- Which plots may need adjustment?
- Which chapters may violate new rules?
- Provide recommendations for updates
