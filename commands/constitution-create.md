## Interview Guidelines

### Dynamic Question Flow

- **Skip irrelevant questions**: If user chooses "No magic" in Q17, skip magic system questions
- **Adapt based on genre**: Fantasy questions differ from sci-fi questions
- **Progressive refinement**: Later questions can refine earlier choices
- **Complexity-based depth**: Simple stories need fewer questions, complex stories need more

### Question Presentation Format

Each question MUST be presented in this format:

```markdown
## Question [N]: [Question Title]

[Brief explanation of what this affects and why it matters]

**Options:**

| Option | Choice | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| A | [Choice A] | [What this means for your novel] |
| B | [Choice B] | [What this means for your novel] |
| C | [Choice C] | [What this means for your novel] |
| D | [Choice D] | [What this means for your novel] |
| E | [Choice E] | [What this means for your novel] |
| F | [Choice F] | [What this means for your novel] |
| Custom | [Your own] | Enter your custom description |

**Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_
```

### User Response Handling

- **Accept letter choices**: A, B, C, D, E, F (case-insensitive)
- **Accept custom input**: Any text input
- **Allow "skip"**: User can skip questions (use intelligent defaults)
- **Allow "back"**: User can go back to previous questions
- **Allow "review"**: User can review current progress anytime
- **Allow "not decided"**: For questions that need more thought

### Mapping Answers to Template

After each answer:
1. Map the choice to specific template sections
2. Update the in-progress constitution
3. Determine next question based on:
   - Current answers
   - Story complexity
   - Genre requirements
4. Continue until all critical sections are covered

### Question Count Management

- **Minimum**: 5 questions (for very simple stories)
- **Typical**: 15-25 questions (for most novels)
- **Maximum**: 30+ questions (for complex epics)
- **Dynamic adjustment**: 
  - If user chooses "simple" options → fewer questions
  - If user chooses "complex" options → more detailed questions
  - If user provides detailed custom answers → can skip follow-ups
