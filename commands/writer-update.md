## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Interactive Update Process

This command uses an **interactive Q&A interview** approach to update a writer profile. The process is **dynamic and adaptive**, focusing only on areas that need changes.

### Process Overview

1. **Identify Writer**: Parse writer ID/name from `$ARGUMENTS` or use current writer
2. **Load Current Profile**: Read existing `.novelkit/writers/[ID]/writer.md`
3. **Display Current State**: Show key characteristics of the current writer
4. **Interactive Update Interview**: Ask targeted questions about what to change
5. **Dynamic Question Flow**: Questions adapt based on what user wants to modify
6. **Apply Changes**: Update the profile with new values
7. **Final Confirmation**: Review changes before saving
8. **Save Updated Profile**: Write back to `.novelkit/writers/[ID]/writer.md`

9. **Update State Machine**:
   - Read `.novelkit/memory/config.json`
   - Read writer profile to get writer name: `.novelkit/writers/[WRITER_ID]/writer.md`
   - If this is the active writer (check `current_writer.id`), update `current_writer.name` if name changed
   - Update `session.last_action`: "Updated writer [writer_id] ([Writer Name])"
   - Update `session.last_action_time`: [current timestamp]
   - Update `session.last_action_command`: "writer-update"
   - Update `session.last_modified_file`: `.novelkit/writers/[WRITER_ID]/writer.md`
   - Update `session.action_context`: "[Summary of changes]"
   - Add to `history.recent_actions` array (keep last 20 entries):
     - `{"action": "updated_writer", "writer_id": [writer_id], "changes": "[summary]", "timestamp": [ISO 8601], "command": "writer-update"}`
   - Update `last_updated`: [current timestamp]
   - Save updated config.json

- **Focus on changes**: Only ask about areas user wants to modify
- **Adaptive depth**: If user wants "comprehensive update", ask more questions
- **Progressive refinement**: Later questions can refine earlier changes

### Question Presentation Format

Each question MUST be presented in this format:

```markdown
## Question [N]: [Question Title]

| D | [Option D] | [What this means] |
| E | [Option E] | [What this means] |
| F | [Option F] | [What this means] |
| Custom | [Your own] | Enter your custom value |

**Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_
```

### User Response Handling

- **Accept letter choices**: A, B, C, D, E, F (case-insensitive)

- **Accept custom input**: Any text input
- **Allow "skip"**: User can skip questions (keep current)
