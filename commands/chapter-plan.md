You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Interactive Interview Process

This command uses an **interactive Q&A interview** approach to plan the next chapter. It automatically reads the latest completed chapter from `config.json` and analyzes it to generate intelligent suggestions.

### Process Overview

1. **Read Latest Chapter** (Automatic):
   - Read `.novelkit/memory/config.json` to get `current_chapter`
   - If no completed chapter exists, start from scratch
   - Read the latest completed chapter file
   - Analyze chapter content (plot, characters, locations, foreshadowing, etc.)

2. **Interactive Interview**: Conduct a series of questions about the next chapter
3. **Dynamic Question Flow**: Questions adapt based on previous answers and chapter analysis
4. **Auto-Generate 3 Versions** (if user is uncertain): Generate 3 different planning versions
5. **Final Confirmation**: Review and confirm before saving
6. **Save Plan**: Write to `.novelkit/chapters/[chapter-id]/plan.md` (meta-space, relative to project root)

## Interview Structure

### Phase 1: Intelligent Context Loading & Analysis (Automatic)

**CRITICAL: You MUST intelligently read all relevant context before planning.**

#### Step 1: Read Latest Chapter & Extract References

1. **Read Latest Completed Chapter**:
   - Read `.novelkit/memory/config.json` → `current_chapter` or `history.chapter_creations[-1]`

   - Extract all mentioned entities:
     - Character names
     - Location names
     - Item names
     - Plot references
     - Faction names

   - **Also read**: Related main plots mentioned in chapter or config

3. **Read Active Subplots**:
   - Check `config.json` → `active_plot.side_plot_ids[]`
