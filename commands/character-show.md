## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty). Support both character ID (character-xxx) and name matching.

## Process Overview

This command retrieves and displays the full profile of a specified character, including all details from the character template. It also provides context by reading related information like relationships, faction details, and plot involvement.

### Process Steps

1. **Identify Character**: Parse ID/name from `$ARGUMENTS` or prompt user
2. **Load Character Profile**: Read the character file
3. **Load Context**: Read related information (factions, relationships, plots)
4. **Format Display**: Present profile in organized, readable format
5. **Provide Interactive Options**: Offer follow-up actions

## Detailed Process

### Phase 1: Character Identification

#### Step 1: Parse Character Identifier

**If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided**:
- Try to match as character ID (format: `character-xxx`)
- If not found, try name matching (fuzzy search)
- Support partial matches

**If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty**:
- Prompt user: "Which character would you like to view?"
- Suggest: "Enter character ID (character-xxx) or name"
- Optionally list recent characters from config.json

#### Step 2: Run Show Script

Execute the character manager script:

```bash
./scripts/bash/character-manager.sh show "$ARGUMENTS"
```

The script should:
- Locate character file in `./world/characters/[character-id]/character.md` (user space, project root)
- Return JSON with:
  - Character ID
  - Character name
  - File path
  - Last modified date
  - Status (if available)

#### Step 3: Handle Identification Errors

**If character not found**:
- List similar names (fuzzy matching)
- Suggest: "Did you mean [similar name]?"
- Offer to create new character: `/novel.character.new`
- Offer to list all characters: `/novel.character.list`

### Phase 2: Load Character Profile

#### Step 4: Read Character File

Read the full character profile from the path returned by script:
- File location: `./world/characters/[character-id]/character.md` (user space, project root)
